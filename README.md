### Mobile Flashcards

A react-native app that lets you create decks of flashcards and quiz
yourself on them.

Instructions for running: 'npm install' and 'npm start' to start the packager. Follow the instructions
to run the app on an emulator or the expo app.

Tested only on Android.

All of the code here is my own, except for the notification helper functions, which I copied from the UdaciFitness example project and mostly didn't change.
